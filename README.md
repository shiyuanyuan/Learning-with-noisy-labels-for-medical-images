## abstract

There are many factors associated with the success of deep learning. One of the most important is the availability of large-scale datasets with clean annotations. However, it is particularly difficult to obtain such datasets with accurate labels for medical image domain. The reliability and consistency of medical imaging labeling are the issues and there usually exists low-quality annotations with label noise. As the noisy labels degrade the generalization performance of deep neural networks, learning with noisy labels is becoming an important task for medical image analysis. The literature on this topic has expanded in volume and scope. However, no recent surveys exist to collect and organize this knowledge, impeding the ability of researchers and practitioners to utilize it. In this paper, we present an up-to-date survey of label-noise learning for medical image domain. Through the analysis of labeling procedure, we conclude three typical types of label noise: label flip noise for classification tasks, the morphological noise for segmentation tasks, the multi-annotator noise for both classification and segmentation tasks. For every label noise type, we review extensive literatures, illustrate some typical methods and show the unified taxonomies in terms of methodological and task differences. Afterwards, we conduct methodological comparison based on some typical properties of task category, data dimension, organ/disease types and applied strategy. Finally, we spark some new directions based on the characteristics of medical images. Our survey aims to provide researchers and practitioners with a solid understanding of existing medical label-noise learning, such as different label noise types, the main algorithms developed over the past few years, which could help them to investigate new methods to combat with the negative effect of label noise.
